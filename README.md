## Outreach and volunteering <a name="Outreach_volunteering"></a>

* Mentor for undergraduate researchers, Oct 2017 - present
Training undergrads in the Sundar lab on molecular biology techniques, including but not limited to DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, gel electrophoresis, molecular cloning, fluorescence microscopy, protoplasting and rice genetics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I developed an online R learning project with undergrads in the Sundar lab, which covers the basics of data visualization, ANOVA and regression [(GitHub)](https://github.com/cxli233/Online_R_learning).  

* Mentor for visiting faculty, June - July 2019
As part of an NSF-funded outreach program, I trained Dr. Kanyand Matand, from Langston University (an HBCU in Oklahoma) hands-on techniques on PCR primer design, DNA extraction, RNA extraction, reverse transcription, PCR optimization, semi-quantitative RT-PCR and image analysis using imageJ. I also gave instructions on 1) real time qPCR, 2) R programming, 3) data visualization and 4) statistical inference using Tukey tests. With this outreach effort, a publication was produced [Matand et al. 2020](https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-020-2243-7).
